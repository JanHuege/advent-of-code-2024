# Instructions

The solutions are not tested for running as a jar. Maven is rather used for dependency management.

If you still want to run the solutions use the following:

```
mvn package

java --enable-preview -jar target/aoc-2024-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

# Language

Using Java 23 with preview features turned on. For more info please refer to `.devcontainers/devcontainer.json`
